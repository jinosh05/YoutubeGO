We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints
- Showing empathy toward others

Unacceptable behavior includes:
- Trolling or insulting comments
- Public or private harassment
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards and may take appropriate and fair action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate.
